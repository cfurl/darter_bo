## EAHCP Biological Objectives Work Group

This webpage serves as an electronic supplement for the Edwards Aquifer Habitat Conservation Plan - Biological Objectives Work Group - Fountain Darter/SAV team. This Work Group is part of the EAHCP Permit Renewal effort and will serve as an avenue for species experts and other stakeholders to develop recommendations for updating EAHCP Covered Species Biological Objectives. 

The Work Group has been assigned the following tasks:

1. Review USFWS guidance on developing biological objectives provided in the Habitat Conservation Planning and Incidental Take Permit Processing Handbook.  

2. Examine existing biological objectives and develop updated draft biological objectives adhering to HCP handbook recommendations and incorporating best available science surrounding the covered species. 

3. Produce a report for the EAHCP Program Manager detailing recommendations for updating biological objectives as part of the permit renewal effort. 

## USFWS Guidance on Biological Objectives

The USFWS Habitat Conservation Planning Handbook (2016) provides guidance on developing Biological Objectives in [<span style="color: blue">Chapter 9:HCP Conservation Strategy.</span>](https://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/documents/habitat-conservation-planning-handbook-chapter-9.pdf) I would encourage Work Group members to read the short section covering Biological Goals and Biological Objectives. Below is a brief summary of pertinent information retrieved from sections 9.1 Biological Goals and 9.2 Biological Objectives.

It takes careful thought to develop productive and meaningful goals, and it is a critical step. In a few concise statements, goals comprise the HCPâ€™s effort in pursuit of its vision and lay the foundation from which all conservation activities arise. Management activities result from goals, and not the other way around. Goals must be developed before developing objectives and conservation measures to orient management direction, both during plan development and throughout implementation.

Objectives are the incremental steps taken to achieve a goal. Objectives are derived from goals, and they provide a foundation for determining conservation measures, monitoring direction, and evaluating effectiveness of the conservation strategy. The number of objectives per goal will vary, but there should be enough to adequately describe how to achieve the goal. An implementation schedule may be beneficial if a goal has several objectives.

#### SMART Objectives

> <strong>Specific</strong> : Objectives must clearly articulate what is to be achieved. Avoid ambiguity by phrasing objectives clearly.

> <strong>Measurable</strong>: Objectives should contain a measurable element that we can readily monitor to determine success or failure.

> <strong>Achievable</strong>: Objectives must be achievable. If you cannot determine how to achieve an objective, you must discard or rewrite it. Do not ask more of the land or wildlife than it can deliver, and use sound professional judgement to develop reasonable expectations of time, staff, and funds available to pursue the objective.

> <strong>Result-oriented</strong>: Objectives should specify an end result.  We should be able to envision the result of achieving the objective.

> <strong>Time-fixed</strong>: Objectives should indicate the time period during which they will be achieved. 

#### Example Biological Goal and Objectives

<strong>Example goal 1</strong>: Bogus Bat: self-sustaining population of bogus bats in the preserve system that can withstand threats, is genetically representative of neighboring populations, and contributes to the overall recovery of the species.

>Objective 1: Preserve 50% of the hibernacula and all maternity roosts of the bogus bat, in the plan area during the permit term

>Objective 2: Enhance roosting habitat by protection and restoring any abandoned mine, cave, or building in the Preserve System and, if feasible, creating 5 artificial hibernacula during the permit term.

<strong>Example goal 2</strong>: Swamp habitat: hydrologic integrity of the Mucky Swamp within the natural state of variability and function maintained within future climatic constraints.

>Objective 1: preserve all area within 2500 feet of the 1900 high water line of Mucky swamp within 10 years of permit issuance through conservation easements and acquisition in fee title.

>Objective 2: restore historic contours and elevations of Mucky swamp to increase retention and infill of sediment within 3 years of land preservation.

>Objective 3: restore vegetation to historical conditions on preserved lands to increase infill into the Mucky Swamp from Stinky Creek and Curvey Creek within 20 years of permit issuance.

## Existing Biological Goals and Objectives

Chapter 9 of the [<span style="color: blue"> EAHCP </span>](https://www.edwardsaquifer.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Edwards-Aquifer-Recovery-Implementation-Program-Nov-2021.pdf) contains the exisiting Biological Objectives for TWR and the Fountain Darter (Comal species - 4.1.1.1 and San Marcos species - 4.1.1.2).


#### Fountain Darter

The long-term biological goals for the fountain darter are quantified as areal coverage of aquatic vegetation (habitat) within representative river reaches and fountain darter density (population measurement) per aquatic vegetation type. The habitat based and population measurement goals are presented below. 

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="hide"}
cm_combined<-read_csv(".\\kable_goals_cm_combined.csv")
sm_combined<-read_csv(".\\kable_goals_sm_combined.csv")

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
opts <- options(knitr.kable.NA = "-")

cm_combined %>%
  kbl(caption = "Comal River system Fountain darter Long-Term Biological Goals") %>%
kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE, position = "left")

sm_combined %>%
  kbl(caption = "San Marcos River system Fountain darter Long-Term Biological Goals") %>%
kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE, position = "left")


```

Two Biological Objectives accompany the LTBG's for fountain darters in both systems.

1. Submerged aquatic restoration will occur in the LTBG reach areas along with restoration reaches adjacent to the goal reaches.

2. Surface water quality will not exceed a 10% deviation in daily average from long-term water quality averages.

#### Texas Wild-Rice

The long-term biological goals for Texas Wild-Rice are areal coverage of Texas Wild-Rice within specific river reaches of the San Marcos River.

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="hide"}
twr_goal<-read_csv(".\\kable_goals_twr.csv")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
twr_goal %>%
  kbl(caption = "Texas Wild-Rice Long-Term Biological Goals") %>%
kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```


There are three Biological Objectives that accompany the Biological Goals for TWR in the San Marcos.

1. Minimum Texas wild-rice areal coverage per segment during drought of record-like conditions (Table 4-11). 

2. Recreation awareness throughout the whole river at all flows with designated control in the following high quality habitat areas below 100 cfs total San Marcos discharge (Table 4-12). 

3. Active restoration and Texas wild-rice expansion efforts and long-term monitoring focused on high-quality habitat areas.
